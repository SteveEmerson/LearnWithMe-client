# LearnWithMe App Client

## Inspired by a need for teachers and students to make connections during Covid.

### Students can ...

- schedule meetings with teachers
- add notes to meetings
- set personal goals
- track completion of tasks toward goals

### Teachers can ...

- schedule meetings with students
- add notes to meetings
- set goals for students and track progress

## Often school is something that just happens to students. This application was develped under a philosophy of teachers and students working together. Each has a role to play in the learning process.

- Students can make personal goals that only they can edit
- For a meeting to be schuduled, the teacher must add the student to their partner list and the student must add the teacher to their partner list. This places the teacher and student on equal footing when it comes to ownership of the learning process.
